 ### NEWS
 estmodnews.1.t:0 "Russia Withdraws Troops From Border With Ukraine"
 estmodnews.1.d:0 "For months, Western intelligence had feared that Russia was preparing an invasion of the Ukraine. A massive troop build-up was sighted and the Duma had been considering recognizing the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, leaving Ukraine considering mobilisation and martial law. In the aftermath of Kaja Kallas's disappearance, the Estonian Civil War and the ensuing failed operation to quickly seize Estonia, it seems that there will be no invasion of Ukraine any time soon as the build-up near Ukraine has begun evaporating with a new focus on the Baltic Sea area. Only time will tell what this means for Russia's hold in the Donbass."
 estmodnews.1.a:0 "Well, At Least Ukraine Is Safe, Right?"
