 authoritarianism_subideology_desc:0 "Authoritarian governments come in many flavours, but sometimes they do not really quite fit anywhere. They may just be excuses to violently hold on to power, or they may sometimes lean fascist, other times commmunist and other times capitalist. Many of these governments are found all over Africa or Asia, and some notable examples in Europe are Putin's Russia and Lukashenka's Belarus. They have no real ideological makeup, but may very well get one, if need be."

They have a desire for wealth and power, seeking to attain it by appealing to populist rhetoric and the elderly population while failing to follow up on both, then blaming all the other politicians for their failures. Usually, the one thing they do follow up on is their reputation of corruption."

Almost invariably, governments following this line of thought are totalitarian and/or incredibly violent. In Estonia, the Post-Kallas civil war has lead to a resurgence in this far-right ideology, but not all of these fascists are Estonian. Some are fascists who came from Russia to fight for their own vision of Russian supremacy."

Either that, or the situation never changed and its just that no real authority has emerged there. Or, perhaps, somewhere inbetween? In any case, authority will emerge as soon as it does in nearby areas."
